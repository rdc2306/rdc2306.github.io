    <p>
        Photography is one of my oldest hobbies, and one I've started
		making money with on the side. I've been doing it for about 6
		years on and off, with very little formal education. I started back
		when my Grandmother gave me her old camera, and I would be in her
		garden taking pictures of all her flowers, and bugs that would
		reside on the flowers. Since then I've spread out in the things I shoot.
		always looking for more opportunities to learn. It's become a backbone
		to whenever I'm stuck with school, sports, or anything else when I 
		need to take a mental reset. Here are some of my favorite shots,
		as well as my camera, my favorite photography styles, and my dream
		camera. I have a personal/professional portfolio you can check out
		 <a href="https://adobe.ly/4aYChJM"> here</a>.
