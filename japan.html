    <h2>My Plans!</h2>
    <p>
        My minor/certificate at UW is Japanese Professional Communications, and 
		I have the opportunity to go abroad this summer for an internship, as well 
		study abroad my senior year! I plan on making it the capstone of my college
		experience and segway it into my professional career. I've put pictures of 
		both of the programs I'm looking into participating in.
